# calculator system
 Introduction:
A calculator system is a basic tool used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is a simple command-line calculator developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a class.

This calculator is designed to take user input for numbers and operations, process the input, and display the result. It runs continuously until the user chooses to quit the program.

‚≠ê Main Features
User-friendly interface: Clear instructions are displayed to help users operate the calculator.

Basic operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Class-based structure: Makes the program organized and easy to understand.

Continuous execution: The program runs in a loop until the user quits.

Error handling: Manages invalid inputs and division by zero.

Lightweight: No external libraries required; runs with core Python.

üî¨ Scientific Calculator Features:

1.Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, and their inverses.

2.Logarithmic Functions: log, ln, antilog.

3.Exponents and Roots: Powers (x^y), square root, nth root.

4.Factorial: n! for combinatorics and permutations.

5.Constants: œÄ, e, and other mathematical constants.

6.Memory Functions: Store, recall, and clear memory.

7.Complex Numbers: Handle real and imaginary numbers (a + bi).

8.Scientific Notation: Display and accept input in 1.23e+4 form.

9.Unit Conversions: Length, mass, time, temperature, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è How the Program Works
Define the Class:

A class Calculator is created with methods for each operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() etc.

User Input:

The program asks the user to select an operation (+, -, *, /) or quit (q).

Then, it asks the user to enter two numbers.

Perform Operation:

Based on the selected operation, the corresponding method of the class is called.

The result is calculated and shown to the user.

Repeat or Quit:

After displaying the result, the program asks for the next operation.

This continues until the user types 'q' to quit.

üí° Uses of the Calculator Program
‚úÖ Can be used for basic arithmetic calculations in a terminal.

 Great learning tool for beginners to understand:

How classes and objects work in Python.

Taking input from users.

Using conditionals and loops.

Implementing error handling.

üíª Can be extended into a GUI or web-based calculator.

 Conclusion:
This calculator system is a simple yet effective example of how Python can be used to build real-world tools using basic programming concepts. It introduces the concept of classes, user input handling, and control flow in a way that is easy for beginners to follow.
